## Comments: 
This was a challenging assessment, I felt even with the extension we had I lacked the time to refine what I had achieved.
I learnt alot from this assessment but I feel I could have achieved more if I had a bit more time. 
I found it great to learn how to loop a log in and log out, and being able to save and delete accrued data.
Moving forward I'll want to revisit this once I've gotten a better grasp on C++ and give it another go.
